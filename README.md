# Ghidra_CPS2


This is a work-in-progress Ghidra plugin to assist in the disassembly and, hopefully, "decompilation" of CPS2 ROMs (let's be honest, most/all of these were hand written in m68k/z80).

Features:
- Loader that maps the IVT and memory
- Buggy jump table resolution

Future features:
- Less buggy jump table resolution
- Offset table resolution
- ...more?
